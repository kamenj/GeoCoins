kamenj: can you replace the  inputbox for the entercode with own implementation or use the js best open source lib for this purpose ?

GitHub Copilot: I'll replace the basic `window.prompt()` with a better implementation. For this purpose, I'll create a custom modal dialog that's styled to match your app and provides a better user experience. This is better than adding an external library dependency for such a simple use case.

Let me first check the current HTML and CSS structure: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.html)

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.css)

Now I'll create a custom modal dialog for code input. I'll add the HTML structure and CSS styling, then update the JavaScript to use it instead of `window.prompt()`. 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me read the app.js file to find where the prompt is used and create a custom prompt function: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#3420-3420), lines 3420 to 3450

Now I'll add a custom prompt function and replace the window.prompt usage. First, let me find a good place to add the custom prompt function: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 51

Let me find the utility functions section where I can add the custom prompt function: 

Searched text for `function showMessage|function alert|^\/\/ =====.*Utility|^\/\/ =====.*Helper` (`**/v5/app.js`), 4 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1130-1130), lines 1130 to 1180

Perfect! I'll add the custom prompt function after the message helpers. Now let me create the custom prompt function and update the code that uses it: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the code that uses the window.prompt to use the custom prompt instead: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've successfully replaced the basic `window.prompt()` with a custom modal dialog implementation. Here's what I did:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added HTML structure** for the custom modal dialog with:
   - Modal overlay with backdrop
   - Dialog box with header, body, and footer
   - Title, label, input field, Cancel and OK buttons

2. **Added CSS styling** that:
   - Matches your app's theme (light/dark mode support)
   - Includes smooth animations (fade-in and slide-in effects)
   - Provides proper focus states and hover effects
   - Is fully responsive for smaller screens

3. **Created `customPrompt()` function** that:
   - Returns a Promise for async/await usage
   - Accepts title, message, and default value parameters
   - Handles OK, Cancel, Enter key, and Escape key
   - Properly cleans up event listeners
   - Auto-focuses and selects the input text

4. **Updated the code entry point** to use the custom prompt instead of `window.prompt()`

## Benefits:

- **Better UX**: Modern modal dialog with smooth animations
- **Themed**: Automatically matches your light/dark theme
- **Keyboard support**: Enter to submit, Escape to cancel
- **No external dependencies**: Lightweight custom implementation
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the rest of your app
- **Better accessibility**: Proper focus management

The custom modal will now appear when users try to enter a code for a map point, providing a much better experience than the browser's default prompt dialog.

Made changes.

kamenj: hide the 'Code' column from the point table

GitHub Copilot: I'll hide the 'Code' column from the map points table. Let me first find where the table is configured in the app.js file. 

Searched text for `code.*column|column.*code|field.*code|title.*Code` (`**/v5/app.js`), 4 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1420-1420), lines 1420 to 1470

Now I'll remove the Code column by commenting it out or removing it from the table configuration: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! I've hidden the 'Code' column from the map points table by commenting it out. The code is still preserved in case you want to show it again later. Users can still enter codes using the "Enter Code" button in the Actions column, which is the more secure approach since codes won't be visible in the table (even though they were masked with "•••••" for non-owners).

Made changes.
