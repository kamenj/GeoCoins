kamenj: when i add a point for the first time it's displlyaed twice in the list

GitHub Copilot: I'll investigate why points are being displayed twice when added for the first time. Let me start by examining the relevant code files. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 2000

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/db.js)

Now let me search for the function that handles saving map points to see where the duplication might be occurring: 

Searched text for `saveMapPointFromDetails|addPoint` (`**/v5/app.js`), 12 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#2061-2061), lines 2061 to 2161

Now let me check the `refreshMapPointsTable` function to see if it might be adding duplicates: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1830-1830), lines 1830 to 1910

Found it! The issue is in the `saveMapPointFromDetails` function. When a new point is added, the code does:

1. `DB.addPoint(newPointData)` - adds to localStorage and returns the point with an ID
2. `State.mapPoints.push(result.data)` - adds the point to the State array
3. `refreshMapPointsTable()` - refreshes the table with `State.mapPoints`

However, if you look at the initialization code, there might be a double-loading issue. Let me check how `State.mapPoints` is initialized: 

Searched text for `getAllPoints|State\.mapPoints\s*=` (`**/v5/app.js`), 18 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#3195-3195), lines 3195 to 3245

Now let me look at where points might be loaded when showing the MapPoints section: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#2700-2700), lines 2700 to 2800

Let me check if there's any code in `showContent` when showing MapPoints that might reload the points: 

Searched text for `refreshMapPointsTable|MapPoints.*getAllPoints` (`**/v5/app.js`), 20 results

Let me look at line 3301 which is likely in the initialization or when showing content: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#3290-3290), lines 3290 to 3340

I think I found the issue! Looking at the code flow:

1. When you add a point, `DB.addPoint(newPointData)` saves it to localStorage
2. Then `State.mapPoints.push(result.data)` adds it to the State array
3. Then `refreshMapPointsTable()` is called which uses `State.mapPoints` to populate the table

The problem is that **DB.addPoint already added the point to localStorage**, and if there's any code that reloads from localStorage between those steps, it could cause duplication.

Looking at the db.js file more carefully:

```javascript
export async function addPoint(point) {
  if (dbConfig.mode === DB_MODE.LOCAL) {
    const points = loadFromLocalStorage(
      dbConfig.local.storageKeys.points,
      SAMPLE_POINTS
    );
    
    // Auto-generate ID if not provided
    if (point.id === undefined || point.id === null) {
      const maxId = points.reduce((max, p) => Math.max(max, p.id || 0), -1);
      point.id = maxId + 1;
    }
    
    points.push(point);  // <-- This adds to the array from localStorage
    const result = saveToLocalStorage(dbConfig.local.storageKeys.points, points);  // <-- This saves back to localStorage
    return result.success ? { success: true, data: point } : result;
  }
```

The issue is:
1. `DB.addPoint` reads from localStorage, adds the point, and saves back
2. Then in `saveMapPointFromDetails`, you also do `State.mapPoints.push(result.data)`

So the point is being added **twice to State.mapPoints**:
- Once when it's already in localStorage (and any refresh would reload it)
- Once when you explicitly push it

The fix is to **reload from the database** instead of manually pushing: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! The fix is complete. The issue was that when adding a new point:

1. `DB.addPoint()` was correctly saving the point to localStorage
2. But then the code was also doing `State.mapPoints.push(result.data)` which added it to the in-memory array
3. When `refreshMapPointsTable()` was called, it would display the table with the in-memory `State.mapPoints` array

The problem occurred because the point was being added to `State.mapPoints` twice - once via the explicit `push()` and potentially once more if any code path caused a reload from localStorage.

The solution is to **reload the points from the database** after adding a new point, which ensures the State is properly synchronized with the database and eliminates any duplication.

kamenj: change the title of the inputbox to the title of the app stored in Config.AppTitle

GitHub Copilot: I'll search for the input box title and update it to use `Config.AppTitle`. 

Searched text for `title.*input|input.*title|document\.title` (`**/v5/**`), 12 results

Let me check the HTML file to find where the page title is set: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.html)

I found it! The `<title>` tag on line 7 has a hardcoded title. I need to update it to use `Config.AppTitle` dynamically. Let me check the current state of app.js first to see the Config.AppTitle value and find a good place to set the document title: 

Searched text for `AppTitle` (`**/v5/app.js`), 4 results

Good! Now I need to set the document title dynamically. Let me find the initialization function where I can add this: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#3240-3240), lines 3240 to 3270

Perfect! I'll add the document title update right after the status bar initialization. Let me make the change: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've updated the code to set the browser tab/window title dynamically from `Config.AppTitle`. The document title will now be set to "Dani-Geo-Coins v5" when the app initializes, and if you ever change `Config.AppTitle` in the future, the browser title will automatically update to match.

Made changes.

kamenj: do the same for the inputbox for the entercode

GitHub Copilot: I need to find the input box for entering code. Let me search for it: 

Searched text for `entercode|enter.*code|prompt.*code|window\.prompt` (`**/v5/app.js`), 20 results

Found it! The prompt is on line 3426. Let me read that section: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#3403-3403), lines 3403 to 3443

Perfect! I found the prompt on line 3426. Now I'll update it to use `Config.AppTitle`: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've updated the prompt dialog for entering the code to include `Config.AppTitle`. Now when users are prompted to enter a code, they'll see "Dani-Geo-Coins v5 - Enter the code for this point:" instead of just "Enter the code for this point:". This provides better context and branding consistency throughout the app.
