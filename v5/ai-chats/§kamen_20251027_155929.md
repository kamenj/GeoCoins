kamenj: add tester and developer roles for the users

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add tester and developer roles for the users. Let me first examine the current code structure to understand how roles are implemented. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 2000

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/data.js)

Now I can see the structure. The application has a role system with "admin", "seeker", and "hider" roles. I need to add "tester" and "developer" roles. Let me search for where roles are defined and used throughout the codebase. 

Searched text for `role-admin|role-seeker|role-hider` (`**/v5/**`), 11 results

Now I understand the full structure. I need to:
1. Add checkboxes for "tester" and "developer" roles in the HTML
2. Update the app.js to handle these new roles
3. Update the sample data to include users with these roles

Let me make these changes:

Now let's update the sample data to include users with the new roles:

Perfect! I've successfully added tester and developer roles to the application. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **HTML (index.html)**: Added two new checkboxes for "Tester" and "Developer" roles in the user details form fieldset.

2. **JavaScript (app.js)**: 
   - Updated the `fillUserDetails` function to set the checked state for tester and developer role checkboxes
   - Updated the `saveUserDetails` function to include tester and developer roles when collecting checkbox values

3. **Sample Data (data.js)**: Added two new sample users:
   - **Frank** - a user with the "tester" role
   - **Grace** - a user with the "developer" role

The role system already had the infrastructure in place (via the `getRolesArray`, `hasRole`, `addRole`, `removeRole` functions), so these new roles integrate seamlessly with the existing role management API. The roles will:
- Be displayed in the users list table
- Show up in the status bar when logged in
- Be editable when adding/editing users
- Work with all existing role-based functionality

Made changes.
