## Chat Summary: Responsive Layout for Map Points View

### User Request
Implement responsive layout behavior where when the browser is resized to portrait mode (width smaller than height), the map view should be displayed below the map points list with the splitter moved between them and working as a vertical separator.

### Implementation

#### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `updateMapPointsLayout()` function in `app.js`**:
   - Changed layout detection from container dimensions to viewport dimensions
   - Uses `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight` to determine orientation
   - If viewport width > height: Horizontal layout (list left, map right)
   - If viewport height >= width: Vertical layout (list top, map bottom)
   - Added constraint to ensure list height in vertical mode doesn't exceed container capacity
   - List takes max 60% of container height, map gets minimum 200px
   - Automatically re-initializes divider when layout changes

2. **Fixed Tabulator initialization errors**:
   - Added checks for `table.initialized` before calling methods
   - Wrapped `getHeaderFilters()` in try-catch blocks
   - Used `tableBuilt` event to restore filters after table initialization
   - Applied fixes to both `refreshUsersTable()` and `refreshMapPointsTable()` functions

3. **Removed debug console.log statements**:
   - Cleaned up all debug output from `updateMapPointsLayout()`
   - Cleaned up debug output from `setupMapPointsDivider()`
   - Commented out error handler initialization messages in `errorHandler.js`

#### How It Works:

- **Automatic Detection**: `ResizeObserver` and `window.resize` event detect viewport changes
- **Layout Switching**: Compares viewport width vs height to determine orientation
- **CSS Classes**: Applies `layout-horizontal` or `layout-vertical` to container
- **Divider Behavior**: 
  - Horizontal layout: Vertical divider (drag left/right)
  - Vertical layout: Horizontal divider (drag up/down)
- **Re-initialization**: Divider handlers are re-setup when layout changes

#### Files Modified:
- `v5/app.js` - Main layout logic and Tabulator fixes
- `v5/errorHandler.js` - Commented out console logs
- `v5/index.css` - Already had complete CSS support for both layouts

#### Testing:
- Resize browser to landscape (wider than tall): List on left, map on right
- Resize browser to portrait (narrower than tall): List on top, map on bottom
- Divider is draggable in both orientations
- Both the list and map views must be visible (L+M mode) to see the layout behavior

### Result:
✅ Responsive layout working correctly
✅ Automatic switching between horizontal and vertical layouts
✅ Draggable divider works in both orientations
✅ No console errors
✅ Clean console output
