kamenj: add tester and developer roles for the users

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add tester and developer roles for the users. Let me first examine the current code structure to understand how roles are implemented. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 2000

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/data.js)

Now I can see the structure. The application has a role system with "admin", "seeker", and "hider" roles. I need to add "tester" and "developer" roles. Let me search for where roles are defined and used throughout the codebase. 

Searched text for `role-admin|role-seeker|role-hider` (`**/v5/**`), 11 results

Now I understand the full structure. I need to:
1. Add checkboxes for "tester" and "developer" roles in the HTML
2. Update the app.js to handle these new roles
3. Update the sample data to include users with these roles

Let me make these changes:

Now let's update the sample data to include users with the new roles:

Perfect! I've successfully added tester and developer roles to the application. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **HTML (index.html)**: Added two new checkboxes for "Tester" and "Developer" roles in the user details form fieldset.

2. **JavaScript (app.js)**: 
   - Updated the `fillUserDetails` function to set the checked state for tester and developer role checkboxes
   - Updated the `saveUserDetails` function to include tester and developer roles when collecting checkbox values

3. **Sample Data (data.js)**: Added two new sample users:
   - **Frank** - a user with the "tester" role
   - **Grace** - a user with the "developer" role

The role system already had the infrastructure in place (via the `getRolesArray`, `hasRole`, `addRole`, `removeRole` functions), so these new roles integrate seamlessly with the existing role management API. The roles will:
- Be displayed in the users list table
- Show up in the status bar when logged in
- Be editable when adding/editing users
- Work with all existing role-based functionality

Made changes.

kamenj: define the ISSUES_VIEW_LINK as Config field, set it to : "https://github.com/kamenj/SimpleLoginSite/issues"  and add a button 'View Issues'  button to the menu top if the user is in the role of tester or developer. 
define the ISSUES_NEW_LINK as Config field, set it to : "https://github.com/kamenj/SimpleLoginSite/issues/new"  and add a button 'New Issue'  button to the menu top if the user is in the role of tester or developer. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll add the issue links to the Config and create buttons for testers and developers. Let me first check the current state of the data.js file and then make the necessary changes.

Good! Now I'll add the Config fields and create the menu buttons. Let me first find where the Config object is defined and where the DEFAULT_MENU_TOP is configured. 

Searched text for `AppTitle: "Dani-Geo-Coins v5"`, 1 result

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#150-150), lines 150 to 170

Now let me add the issue links configuration right after the AppTitle: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to add the CommandName constants for the new commands and then add them to the DEFAULT_MENU_TOP. Let me find the CommandName section:

Now let me find the DEFAULT_MENU_TOP section to add the new buttons: 

Searched text for `DEFAULT_MENU_TOP: [`, 3 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#868-868), lines 868 to 888

Perfect! Now I'll add the two new buttons for View Issues and New Issue. I'll insert them before the logout button: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the requested features. Here's what I added:

## Changes Made:

1. **Config Fields** - Added two new configuration fields in the `Config` object:
   - `ISSUES_VIEW_LINK: "https://github.com/kamenj/SimpleLoginSite/issues"`
   - `ISSUES_NEW_LINK: "https://github.com/kamenj/SimpleLoginSite/issues/new"`

2. **Command Names** - Added two new command constants:
   - `ViewIssues: "view.issues"`
   - `NewIssue: "new.issue"`

3. **Menu Buttons** - Added two new buttons to `DEFAULT_MENU_TOP`:
   - **"View Issues"** button - Opens the issues page in a new tab
   - **"New Issue"** button - Opens the new issue page in a new tab

4. **Role-Based Visibility** - Both buttons have a `visible` function that:
   - Returns `false` if no user is logged in
   - Returns `false` if the user doesn't exist
   - Returns `true` only if the user has either the `tester` or `developer` role

The buttons will appear in the top menu only when a user with tester or developer role is logged in. When clicked, they will open the respective GitHub issues pages in a new browser tab. Based on your sample data, these buttons will be visible for users: diana, frank, and grace.

Made changes.
