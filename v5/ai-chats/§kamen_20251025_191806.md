kamenj: apply the same tabulator  rendering logic for the points table as well.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you apply the same Tabulator rendering logic to the points table. Let me first examine the current code to understand the structure. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 2000

Let me read more of the file to see the points table rendering logic: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js#2000-2000), lines 2000 to 2949

Now I can see the structure. I notice that the users table is using Tabulator with the full rendering logic (around line 856-937), but the points table is still using the old HTML row rendering approach (around line 1386-1402). Let me apply the same Tabulator rendering logic to the points table. 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the getPointsTableColumns function right after the getTableColumns function: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me replace the refreshMapPointsTable function to use Tabulator: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to update the showContent function to save the points table filter state when leaving the MapPoints section: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to update the bindListDelegates function to handle clicks on the Tabulator-rendered table. The current implementation assumes the old HTML structure with tbody. I need to update it to work with the Tabulator table: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me check the HTML structure to ensure the table element is properly set up for Tabulator: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.html)

I can see the HTML still has the old table structure with `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>`. For Tabulator to work properly, I need to change this to just a `<div>` like the users table. Let me update the HTML: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now the points table uses the same Tabulator rendering logic as the users table. The changes I've made include:

1. **Added PointsTable configuration** in the Config object with the same structure as UsersTable
2. **Added State.pointsTable** and **State.pointsTableFilters** to store the Tabulator instance and filter state
3. **Created getPointsTableColumns()** function that defines the columns for the points table with:
   - Index column with row position
   - Title column with header filter and link button formatter
   - User column with header filter
   - Latitude and Longitude columns with number formatting (6 decimal places)
   - Actions column with Delete and Edit buttons
4. **Updated refreshMapPointsTable()** to use Tabulator with:
   - Create/update Tabulator instance
   - Save and restore filter state
   - Handle empty state
   - Alternating row colors
5. **Updated showContent()** to save points table filter state when leaving the MapPoints section
6. **Updated bindListDelegates()** to attach click handlers to the table div instead of tbody
7. **Updated the HTML** to use a `<div>` for the points table instead of `<table>` structure

The points table now has all the same features as the users table:
- Column sorting
- Header filters for searching
- Alternating row colors
- Filter state persistence when navigating away and back
- Responsive layout

Made changes.

kamenj: also add the Compact/Details button in the menu.bottom

GitHub Copilot: I'll add Compact/Details view toggle buttons for the points table in the bottom menu, similar to how the users table works.

First, let me add the view configuration to the PointsTable config: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the getPointsTableColumns function to support both view modes: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the command definitions for the view toggle buttons in the MapPoints commands section: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the actual command definitions in the MapPoints commands list: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to update the refreshMapPointsTable function to use the view mode: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now the points table has Compact/Details view toggle buttons in the bottom menu, just like the users table. The changes I made:

1. **Added `view` property** to `Config.PointsTable` with default value "details"
2. **Added command name constants** `PointsViewDetails` and `PointsViewCompact`
3. **Created two new commands** in the MapPoints commands list:
   - `points.viewDetails` - switches to details view (shows when in compact view)
   - `points.viewCompact` - switches to compact view (shows when in details view)
   - Both commands preserve the menu collapse state
4. **Updated `getPointsTableColumns()`** to accept a `viewMode` parameter and return different column configurations:
   - **Details view**: Shows all columns (#, Title, User, Latitude, Longitude, Actions)
   - **Compact view**: Shows a combined "Point" column with title, coordinates, and user badge, plus Actions
5. **Updated `refreshMapPointsTable()`** to get the current view mode and pass it to `getPointsTableColumns()`

Now users can toggle between a detailed multi-column view and a compact single-column view for the points table, making it easier to view on smaller screens or when you want a more condensed display.

Made changes.
