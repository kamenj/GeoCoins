kamenj: does tabulator as it is support paged view and on demand rendering ?

GitHub Copilot: I'll check the Tabulator documentation and your current implementation to answer your question about paged view and on-demand rendering support.

Yes, **Tabulator fully supports both paged view and on-demand rendering** out of the box:

## 1. **Pagination (Paged View)**
Tabulator has built-in pagination support. Currently in your config it's disabled, but you can enable it:

```javascript
Config.UsersTable = {
  pagination: true,        // ← Currently set to false
  paginationSize: 10,      // ← Rows per page (already configured)
  // ... rest of config
}
```

This will automatically add page controls and split your data into pages.

## 2. **Virtual DOM (On-Demand Rendering)**
Tabulator uses **virtual DOM rendering by default** - it only renders rows that are currently visible in the viewport. This is automatic and built-in, no configuration needed. This means:

- Only visible rows are rendered to the DOM
- As you scroll, rows are dynamically created/destroyed
- Excellent performance with large datasets (thousands of rows)
- No extra configuration required - it just works

## 3. **Progressive Loading (Remote Data)**
Tabulator also supports:
- **Progressive loading** - loading data in chunks as you scroll
- **Remote pagination** - fetching pages from a server as needed
- **Ajax requests** - loading data on demand from an API

Your current implementation loads all data client-side, but Tabulator can easily be configured for remote data if your dataset grows very large.

**Bottom line:** Tabulator is designed for high-performance tables with large datasets. The virtual DOM rendering is already working in your app, and pagination is just a config toggle away.
