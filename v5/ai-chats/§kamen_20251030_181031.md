# Fix MapPoints Table Resizing on Layout Mode Change

## Problem
The mappoints table was not correctly resizing when switching between portrait (vertical layout) and landscape (horizontal layout) modes, even though it worked correctly when using the splitter within the same layout mode.

## Root Cause
When switching from portrait to landscape mode (or vice versa), the layout change code would:
1. Change CSS classes (`layout-horizontal` / `layout-vertical`)
2. Set CSS variables for default sizes
3. Re-setup the divider handlers

However, it did NOT:
- Clear the inline `style.width` and `style.height` from the previous layout mode
- Refresh the table to recalculate its dimensions

This caused the `#mapPointsList` element to retain inline styles from the previous layout, preventing the table from properly sizing in the new layout.

## Solution
Modified the `updateMapPointsLayout()` function to:
1. **Clear inline styles** when layout mode changes - removes leftover `width` and `height` from previous layout
2. **Destroy and recreate the table** after layout change to recalculate dimensions properly
3. **Preserve table filters** during recreation for better UX

Additionally improved table resizing during splitter drag:
- Calculate table height from parent container (`#mapPointsList.clientHeight`) instead of the table element itself
- Update table height in real-time during drag using `setHeight()` and `redraw()`
- Set height on both Tabulator API and DOM element for consistency

## CSS Improvements
- Changed `.tabulator` to use flexbox layout (`display: flex; flex-direction: column`)
- Changed `.tabulator` overflow from `visible` to `hidden` (required for height constraints)
- Made `.tabulator-tableholder` flex-grow to fill available space (`flex: 1; min-height: 0`)
- Changed `.mappoints-list` overflow from `auto` to `hidden` (let table handle scrolling)

## Files Modified
- `v5/app.js`:
  - `updateMapPointsLayout()` - Added inline style clearing and table refresh on layout change
  - `setupMapPointsDivider()` - Added real-time table resizing during vertical splitter drag
  - `refreshMapPointsTable()` - Fixed height calculation to measure parent container

- `v5/index.css`:
  - Updated `.tabulator` flexbox rules
  - Updated `.tabulator-tableholder` to fill available space
  - Changed `.mappoints-list` overflow behavior

## Testing
Verified that:
- Table resizes correctly when switching from portrait to landscape
- Table resizes correctly when switching from landscape to portrait
- Table resizes smoothly during horizontal splitter drag (top/bottom split)
- Table resizes smoothly during vertical splitter drag (left/right split)
- Table filters are preserved during layout changes
