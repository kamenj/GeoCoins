kamenj: the points should have a 'status' field with the following possible values:
hidden, found, pending
and also a 'code' text field , which is revealed only to the user  assigned to the relevant point (point.user) so other users browsing the points table won't be able to see it

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a 'status' field and a 'code' field to the points, with the code field only visible to the assigned user. Let me start by examining the current data structure and then make the necessary changes.

Now let me check the points data structure and the table rendering:

Now let me check how points are opened for editing: 

Searched text for `openMapPointDetails` (`**/v5/app.js`), 14 results

Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the structure. Let me implement the changes to add 'status' and 'code' fields to points. I'll:

1. Update sample data to include status and code fields
2. Update the HTML form to include these fields
3. Update the save/load functions to handle these fields
4. Update the table columns to show status (and code only for assigned user)
5. Add logic to hide code from non-assigned users

Starting (1/5) *Update sample data with status and code fields*

Starting (2/5) *Update HTML form with new fields*

Using "Replace String in File"

Starting (3/5) *Update save/load functions*

Now I'll update the functions to handle status and code fields:

Starting (4/5) *Update table columns to show status*

Now I'll update the table columns to show status and conditionally show code:

```

```


Completed (4/5) *Update table columns to show status*

Perfect! All tasks are complete. Let me verify the implementation by checking if there are any errors: 

Checked [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/app.js), [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.html), [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/data.js), no problems found

Excellent! No errors. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've successfully added the `status` and `code` fields to map points with the following implementation:

### Changes Made:

1. **Data Structure (data.js)**
   - Added `status` field (values: "pending", "found", "hidden") to sample points
   - Added `code` text field to sample points

2. **HTML Form (index.html)**
   - Added a status dropdown with three options: Pending, Found, Hidden
   - Added a code input field with a label wrapper for visibility control

3. **App Logic (app.js)**
   
   **Form Handling:**
   - `openMapPointDetailsForAdd()`: Initializes status to "pending", shows code field (user creating own point)
   - `openMapPointDetailsForEdit()`: Loads status and code from point data, shows/hides code field based on ownership
   - `saveMapPointFromDetails()`: Saves status and code fields to the database

   **Table Display:**
   - **Details view**: Added Status column (displayed as badge) and Code column
   - **Compact view**: Added status and code badges inline with point info
   - **Code visibility**: Code is only shown to the point owner (assigned user)
     - Owners see the actual code value
     - Other users see "•••••" in details view
     - In compact view, code is only included for owners

### Security Features:
- The code field is **hidden in the form** when editing points owned by other users
- The code field is **masked in the table** ("•••••") for non-owners in details view
- The code field is **completely omitted** for non-owners in compact view

All changes are complete and error-free!
