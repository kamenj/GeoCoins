kamenj: replace the About info with a short info about the app and at the end append :
Developed by: Kamen Zehchev (kamenj@hotmail.com)

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you update the About info. Let me first check the current About content in the app. 

Searched text for `About.*Dani-Geo-Coins|aboutContent|About this app` (`**/v5/app.js`), no results

Searched text for `About` (`**/v5/index.html`), 10 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v5/index.html#200-200), lines 200 to 220

Now I'll replace the About section content with a short app description and the developer info: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! I've updated the About section with:
- A concise description of the Dani-Geo-Coins app
- Information about its key features (roles, map interactions, user management)
- Developer credit: Kamen Zehchev (kamenj@hotmail.com) with a clickable email link

Made changes.
