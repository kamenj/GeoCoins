create an html page and js file that:

1. html has 4 div elements:
   1.0) menu div
   1.1) login page div
   1.2) register user div
   1.3) users list div
   1.4) user details div
   1.5)  message div
   1.6) map points div
   1.7) map point details div
   1.8) settings div
 

   each div is expandable/collapsible by clicking on its header
   each div has a unique id
   each div can be shown/hidden by js functions

2. js file has functions to:
   2.1) store users array
   2.2) add user to users array
   2.3) remove user from users array
   2.4) display users in users list div
   2.5) show message in  message div
   2.6) add map point to map points div
   2.7) clear map points from map points div
   2.8) toggle visibility of each div by id
   2.9) expand/collapse each div by id
   2.10) handle login functionality (simple username input and store in users array)
   2.11) save/restore the visible and collapsed state of each div

Here is a simple implementation of the requested HTML page and JavaScript file:
1.0) menu div - has settings and about  buttons 
 -clicking the settings button shows the settings div and hides all other divs
    -clicking the about button shows the message div with info about the application and its author
1.1) login page div - has username and password input, login button and register button

- if the login is successful, display a welcome message with the username in the menu div
- if the login fails, display an  message in the  message div

1.2) register user div - has username, password, name , surname and gender input and register and cancel button - if the registration is successful, add the    user to the users list and display a success message in the menu div
  and navigate to the login page div, and hide the register user div - if the registration fails (e.g. username already exists), display an error message in the  message div
 -if cancel button is clicked, navigate to the login page div, and hide the register user div

1.3) users list div - displays the list of registered users - if there are no users, display a message indicating that no users are registered - if there are users, display their usernames in a tabular format, using alternating row colors for better readability
and flex grid or simple html table.
clicking on a username displays the user details in the user details div

1.4) user details div - displays the details of a selected user (username, name, surname) and has a delete button - clicking the delete button removes the user from the users array and updates the users list div - if the deleted user is currently logged in, log them out and navigate to the login page div
also has a save button - clicking the save button updates the user details in the users array and updates and navigates back to the users list div,
selecting the row where the edited user is located


1.5)  message div - displays  messages and has an 'OK' button - as in 2.11) saves the visible and collapsed state of each div - all other divs are hidden when the  message div is visible - when the OK button is clicked, the  message div is hidden and the previous state of all other divs is restored
 - also there is an option to define which div to show after the message div is closed

1.6) map points div - displays map points for all users in a tabular format, using alternating row colors for better readability
and flex grid or simple html table. clicking on a map point displays the map point details in the map point details div

1.7) map point details div - displays details of a selected map point. has a delete button 
- clicking the delete button removes the map point from the map points div and updates the map points div 
- also has a save button - clicking the save button updates the map point details in the map points div and navigates back to the map points div, selecting the row where the edited map point is located

each array modification is also saved in the local storage
when the page is reloaded, the users array and map points are restored from local storage

 1.8) settings div - accessible by a button in the menu div 
    - has options to change the theme (light/dark) and font size (small/medium/large) of the page - changes are applied immediately 
            and saved in  local storage 
    - when the page is reloaded, the theme and font size are restored from local storage
    - has a reset button to clear all local storage data and reset the page to default settings 
 1.9) about div - accessible by a button in the menu div 
    displays information about the application and its author

generate the two separate html and js file contents and use simple html and css and js constructs so that they are easily understandable and modifiable by a beginner.
