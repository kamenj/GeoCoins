kamenj: when both list and mapview are displayed - add ability to drag the common border between them, so that the widths in horizontal mode and the heights in vertical can be defined by the user ui

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a draggable divider between the list and map view so users can resize them. Let me first check the current implementation to understand the layout structure.

Now I can see the structure. The map and list views are in a flex container with either horizontal or vertical layout. I'll add a draggable divider between them that allows the user to resize the panels.

Now I'll add the JavaScript code to handle the draggable divider functionality:

Now I'll add the draggable divider functionality to the app.js file: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I'll add the function to handle the draggable divider. I'll insert it before the `loadAll` function:

```

```
Now I need to update the visibility logic for the divider - it should only be visible when both views are shown:

```

```
Now I need to also update the initial view setup to handle the divider visibility:

```

```
Perfect! Now I've implemented a draggable divider between the list and map views. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've added a draggable divider between the list and map views in the MapPoints section that allows users to resize the panels by dragging the border. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Made:

1. **HTML (index.html)**: Added a divider element between the list and map views
   - `<div id="mapPointsDivider" class="mappoints-divider"></div>`

2. **CSS (index.css)**: Added styling for the divider
   - **Horizontal layout**: 8px wide divider with col-resize cursor
   - **Vertical layout**: 8px tall divider with row-resize cursor
   - Visual feedback on hover and during drag (changes to accent color)
   - Visual grip indicator in the center of the divider

3. **JavaScript (app.js)**: Implemented drag functionality
   - `setupMapPointsDivider()`: Sets up mouse and touch event handlers
   - Supports both horizontal (left/right) and vertical (top/bottom) layouts
   - Enforces minimum/maximum sizes for both panels (min 200-300px, max leaves 200px for the other panel)
   - Updates the map size during and after resizing
   - Divider is only visible when both views are displayed
   - Works with both mouse and touch input for mobile compatibility

### Behavior:
- When **both** list and map are visible, the divider appears and can be dragged to adjust the split
- In **horizontal mode** (wide screens): drag left/right to adjust panel widths
- In **vertical mode** (tall screens): drag up/down to adjust panel heights
- When only **one view** is shown, the divider is hidden
- The divider provides visual feedback (color change) on hover and during dragging
- The map automatically adjusts and re-renders as you resize

The feature is fully integrated with your existing view toggle system (List/Map/L+M buttons).
