kamenj: add 'Delete' button to the map places popup , whic when clicked will delete the relevant existing point or 'new-point' pin

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a 'Delete' button to the map popup that will delete the relevant point. Let me first check the current popup implementation.

Now I can see the popup implementations. I need to:
1. Add a Delete button to both the existing point popups and the new point (temp placemark) popup
2. Handle the delete action for both cases

Let me check how points are deleted currently:

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#1373-1373), lines 1373 to 1413

Perfect! Now I understand the structure. I'll update the popup content to include a Delete button for both existing points and the new point marker. Let me implement this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to add the two global functions that will be called from the popup buttons. Let me find a good place to add them: 

Searched text for `window\.|global functions` (`**/v4/app.js`), 14 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#2220-2220), lines 2220 to 2237

Now I'll add the two global functions just before the `loadAll` event listener: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added the Delete button functionality to the map popups. Here's what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated the temporary "new point" marker popup** (lines ~1570, 1577):
   - Added a Delete button that removes the temporary marker when clicked
   - The button appears in both the initial popup and after dragging the marker

2. **Updated existing map point popups** (line ~1620):
   - Added a Delete button to each existing point's popup
   - The button includes the point's ID to identify which point to delete

3. **Added two global functions** (before the `loadAll` event listener):
   - `window.appDeleteTempMarker()`: Removes the temporary new-point marker from the map
   - `window.appDeleteMapPoint(pointId)`: Deletes an existing map point with confirmation
     - Shows a confirmation dialog before deleting
     - Removes the point from the database
     - Updates the State.mapPoints array
     - Refreshes both the table list and map markers
     - Shows an error alert if the deletion fails

The Delete buttons are styled with a small top margin (5px) to separate them from the popup content, and they work for both the temporary "new point" pin and existing saved points on the map.

Made changes.

kamenj: also add 'Add' button , which has the same effect as cloicking on the 'Add map point' button

GitHub Copilot: I'll add an 'Add' button to the temporary new-point marker popup that has the same effect as clicking the 'Add map point' button. 

Searched text for `PointsAdd|openMapPointDetails|add map point` (`**/v4/app.js`), 20 results

Perfect! I can see that `openMapPointDetailsForAdd()` is the function that gets called when the "Add map point" button is clicked. Now I'll update the popup content to include an 'Add' button: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to add the global function for the Add button. Let me update the global functions section: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added an 'Add' button to the temporary new-point marker popup. Here's what changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated the temporary marker popup content** (lines ~1570, 1577):
   - Added an 'Add' button alongside the Delete button
   - Updated the text from "Drag to adjust or click 'Add map point'" to just "Drag to adjust" since the button is now directly in the popup
   - Added margin-right to the Add button for spacing between the two buttons

2. **Added global function** `window.appAddMapPoint()`:
   - Calls `openMapPointDetailsForAdd()` which opens the map point details form
   - This has the exact same effect as clicking the "Add map point" button in the toolbar

Now users can click the 'Add' button directly in the popup to open the form for adding the new map point, making it more convenient than having to find and click the "Add map point" button in the toolbar.

Made changes.

kamenj: when clickng the Cancel button in the <span class="title-text">Map Point Details </span> - do not refresh/rezoom etc.  the map

GitHub Copilot: I'll find where the Cancel button is handled in the Map Point Details section and remove any map refresh/rezoom logic. 

Searched text for `MpdCancel|mpd\.cancel` (`**/v4/app.js`), 6 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#460-460), lines 460 to 490

Good! I can see the Cancel button handler uses a `State.skipMapRefresh` flag. Let me check the `showContent` function to see where the map refresh happens: 

Searched text for `function showContent|skipMapRefresh` (`**/v4/app.js`), 8 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#1520-1520), lines 1520 to 1560

Perfect! I can see that the `State.skipMapRefresh` flag is already being checked at line 1528, and it prevents `refreshMapMarkers()` from being called. However, the map still does `invalidateSize()` which can cause the map to rezoom. Let me check if there's more to the issue by looking at the `showContent` function: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#699-699), lines 699 to 779

I can see that when showing the MapPoints content, it calls `initializeLeafletMap()` after a 100ms delay. The issue is that `initializeLeafletMap()` checks `skipMapRefresh` but still does `invalidateSize()`. Let me look more closely at the zoom behavior. Let me check if `refreshMapMarkers` does any zooming: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#1635-1635), lines 1635 to 1675

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#1600-1600), lines 1600 to 1630

Ah! I found it! The `refreshMapMarkers()` function at line 1626 calls `fitBounds()` which rezooms the map to fit all markers. This is what's causing the unwanted zoom behavior when canceling. The `skipMapRefresh` flag prevents this function from being called, which is good.

However, looking at the cancel handler again, it seems the logic is already there. Let me verify that it's working correctly. Actually, wait - let me check if there's something else that might be refreshing the map. Let me look more carefully at the flow:

Actually, I see the issue now. The `State.skipMapRefresh` flag is being set and then immediately unset in the cancel handler, but then `showContent("mapPoints")` is called, which will initialize the map. The problem is that even though `skipMapRefresh` is checked in `initializeLeafletMap()`, it might not be preventing everything we need.

Looking at line 1528, when the map already exists and we're just refreshing, it does:
1. `invalidateSize()` - this is fine, it just recalculates the map size
2. Conditionally calls `refreshMapMarkers()` only if `!State.skipMapRefresh`

So the current implementation should already be working. But let me verify the initialization path isn't causing issues. Let me look at what happens when the map is first created: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v4/app.js#1490-1490), lines 1490 to 1520

I see! When the map is first initialized (line 1507-1521), it calls `refreshMapMarkers()` unconditionally at line 1522, without checking `skipMapRefresh`. This is the problem! When canceling from Map Point Details back to Map Points, if this is the first time showing the map, it will call `refreshMapMarkers()` which does `fitBounds()` and rezooms.

Let me fix this by adding the `skipMapRefresh` check to the initialization path as well: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now when clicking Cancel in the Map Point Details section, the map will not refresh or rezoom because:

1. The cancel button handler sets `State.skipMapRefresh = true` before calling `showContent("mapPoints")`
2. When `showContent` calls `initializeLeafletMap()`:
   - If the map is being initialized for the first time, it will skip calling `refreshMapMarkers()` (which does the `fitBounds()` zoom)
   - If the map already exists, it will only do `invalidateSize()` (resize) but skip `refreshMapMarkers()`
3. Then it sets `State.skipMapRefresh = false` to restore normal behavior

This means the map will maintain its current zoom level and position when you cancel out of the Map Point Details form.
