kamenj: show the users's roles in the status bar when logged in

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you display the user's roles in the status bar when logged in. Let me first examine the current structure to understand how the status bar and user roles are implemented.

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/index.html)

Now I can see the structure. The status bar currently shows the username, but not the roles. I need to modify the `setStatusBarUser` function to include the user's roles when displaying the logged-in user information. 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me check if there are any errors in the code: 

Checked [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/app.js), no problems found

Perfect! I've successfully updated the status bar to display the user's roles when they're logged in. 

Here's what was changed:

- Modified the `setStatusBarUser()` function in app.js to include role information
- When a user is logged in, it now looks up the user object and gets their roles using the existing `getRolesDisplay()` function
- The roles are displayed in square brackets after the username, showing the first letter of each role in uppercase (e.g., "User: alice [A, S]" for a user with admin and seeker roles)
- If the user has no roles, only the username is shown
- When no user is logged in, it continues to show "Not logged in" as before

The implementation reuses the existing `getRolesDisplay()` function which formats roles as uppercase first letters separated by commas, ensuring consistency with how roles are displayed in the users list table.

Made changes.
