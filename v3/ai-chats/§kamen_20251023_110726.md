kamenj: Add Config field 'AutoHideTopMenu' which can be modified through the Setting content div, and when it's True - hides the top menu div when some of the Content divs is displayed. Ensure that each Content div has a 'Cancel' button assigned to it, which hides the that content div and displays the top menu again.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add the 'AutoHideTopMenu' configuration feature. Let me first examine the current structure of the v3 app to understand the implementation.

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/data.js)

Now let me check the CSS to understand the styling: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/index.css)

Now I understand the structure. I need to:
1. Add an `AutoHideTopMenu` field to the Config settings
2. Modify the Settings section in HTML to include a checkbox for this config
3. Update the `showContent` function to hide/show the top menu based on this setting
4. Ensure all content sections have Cancel buttons (most already do)
5. Update the settings save/load logic

Let me implement these changes: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me update the HTML to add the AutoHideTopMenu checkbox in the Settings section: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to verify that all content sections have Cancel buttons. Let me check the Commands configuration to ensure all sections have cancel actions that will show the top menu again. Looking at the code, I can see:

1. Login - has `login.cancel` ✓
2. Register - has `register.cancel` ✓
3. UsersList - has `users.cancel` ✓
4. UserDetails - has `user.cancel` ✓
5. Message - has `message.ok` ✓
6. MapPoints - missing a Cancel button ✗
7. MapPointDetails - has `mpd.cancel` ✓
8. Settings - has `settings.close` ✓
9. About - has `about.ok` ✓

I need to add a Cancel button to the MapPoints section. Let me update the configuration: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to add the command name constant for the new cancel command: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me verify that the code is properly handling the menu visibility when content is hidden. I also need to ensure the `renderMenusFor` function properly manages the top menu when autoHideTopMenu is enabled. Let me update the `renderMenusFor` function to respect the autoHideTopMenu setting: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now let me check if there are any errors in the code: 

Checked [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/app.js), [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/index.html), no problems found

Excellent! No errors found. Let me create a summary document of the changes made:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the `AutoHideTopMenu` configuration feature for your v3 app. Here's what was added:

### Changes Made:

1. **New Config Field**: Added `autoHideTopMenu` to the `State.settings` object (default: `false`)

2. **Settings UI**: Added a checkbox in the Settings section to enable/disable the auto-hide feature:
   - Label: "Auto-hide top menu when viewing content"
   - When checked, the top menu will be hidden when any content div is displayed

3. **Logic Implementation**:
   - Modified `showContent()` function to hide the top menu when content is shown and `autoHideTopMenu` is enabled
   - Updated `setMenusVisibility()` function to respect the `autoHideTopMenu` setting
   - Modified `openSettings()` to load the checkbox state
   - Updated `applySettings()` to save the checkbox value
   - Ensured settings are properly loaded from the database on startup

4. **Cancel Buttons**: 
   - All content sections already had Cancel/Close/OK buttons except MapPoints
   - Added a **Cancel** button to the MapPoints section that hides the content and shows the top menu again
   - All cancel buttons use `showContent(null)` which automatically shows the top menu

### How It Works:

- **When `AutoHideTopMenu` is disabled (default)**: The app behaves as before - top menu is always visible when it has content
- **When `AutoHideTopMenu` is enabled**: 
  - The top menu is hidden when any content div is displayed
  - Clicking any Cancel/Close/OK button in the content sections hides that content and shows the top menu again
  - The top menu is always visible when no content is displayed

All changes maintain backward compatibility and the feature is disabled by default, so existing behavior is preserved.

Made changes.

kamenj: AutoHideTopMenu should be enabled by default

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the default value of `AutoHideTopMenu` to `true`. Let me make the changes: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've updated the `AutoHideTopMenu` setting to be enabled by default (`true`). The changes were made in two places:

1. **Initial State**: Set `autoHideTopMenu: true` in the `State.settings` object
2. **Database Load Fallback**: Set `autoHideTopMenu: true` in the default settings object used when loading from the database fails or returns no data

Now when users first load the app or reset settings, the top menu will automatically hide when viewing content sections.

Made changes.
