kamenj: adjust the html rendering code to make sure that the menu buttons width is enough to contain the whole button  text

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you adjust the HTML rendering code to ensure menu buttons have enough width for their text. Let me first examine the current code to understand the implementation.

Now I can see the issue. The menu buttons are using `grid-template-columns: 1fr` which makes them take the full width, but the button text might be wrapping or getting cut off. Looking at the CSS, I can see that `.cmd-btn` buttons have `text-align: left` and `width: 100%`. The issue is likely that some button captions are too long and might need better width handling.

Let me adjust the CSS to ensure menu buttons have enough width to contain their text properly: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've adjusted the CSS for the menu buttons to ensure they have enough width to contain the whole button text. The changes include:

1. **`white-space: nowrap;`** - Prevents text from wrapping to multiple lines
2. **`overflow: visible;`** - Allows the button to expand beyond its container if needed
3. **`min-width: fit-content;`** - Ensures the button is at least wide enough for its content

These changes will make sure that button text like "Add user", "Add map point", "Refresh", etc., won't be cut off or wrapped, and the buttons will automatically size to fit their content while still maintaining the full width layout when possible.

Made changes.
