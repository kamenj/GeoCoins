kamenj: dont dock the bottom menu , display it at the end of the other contents...always as the last content div

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the bottom menu so it's displayed at the end of the content instead of being docked. Let me first examine the current HTML and CSS files to understand the structure.

Now I can see the issue. The bottom menu has the class `dock dock-bottom` which uses `position: fixed` to dock it at the bottom of the viewport. I need to:

1. Remove the docking classes from the bottom menu in HTML
2. Update the body padding since we won't need bottom padding anymore

Let me make these changes: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've made the necessary changes:

1. **Removed the docking from the bottom menu** - Changed `<div id="menuBottom" class="section dock dock-bottom">` to `<div id="menuBottom" class="section">` in the HTML file
2. **Updated the body padding** - Changed the bottom padding from `72px` to `8px` in the CSS file, so there's no longer extra space reserved for a fixed bottom menu

Now the bottom menu will display as a regular content section at the end of the page, flowing naturally with the rest of the content. It will scroll with the page instead of being fixed at the bottom of the viewport.

Made changes.

kamenj: the statusbar div should not be docked but displayed as first content , the top menu shouldn't be docked, but displayed as conent right below the status bar div

GitHub Copilot: I'll remove the docking from both the status bar and top menu so they display as regular content at the beginning of the page. Let me make these changes:

Perfect! I've made all the necessary changes:

1. **Removed docking from the status bar** - Changed from `class="status-bar dock dock-top"` to just `class="status-bar"`
2. **Removed docking from the top menu** - Changed from `class="section dock dock-top-menu"` to just `class="section"`
3. **Updated body padding** - Changed from `padding: 88px 8px 8px` to `padding: 8px` so there's no reserved space at the top
4. **Updated status bar styling** - Added `border-radius: 6px` and `margin: 10px 0` so it flows naturally with the other content sections

Now all content (status bar, top menu, middle sections, and bottom menu) will flow naturally from top to bottom, scrolling together as regular page content. Nothing is docked or fixed to the viewport anymore.

kamenj: when the user login fails, i correctly get the message :
Login failed. Wrong username or password.
but the bottom menu with the 'OK' button on it is not displayed

GitHub Copilot: Let me examine the app.js file to understand how the message section and bottom menu are being controlled when login fails. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/my.desktop/projects/.mind.maps/main/software/dani/maps/tests/html/FindCoins/SimpleLoginSite/v3/app.js)

I can see the issue! When the `showMessage` function is called after a failed login, it calls `showContent("message")` which should render the menus for the message section. The message section has a command defined for "message.ok" in the bottom menu. However, the `on_before_command_added` function is filtering out commands when the user is not logged in.

Looking at line 847-867 in the app.js file, when there's no logged-in user (`!State.currentUser`), it only allows specific commands like `LoginOk`, `RegisterOk`, etc., but it doesn't include `MessageOk` in the allowed list. This is why the "OK" button doesn't appear when the login fails.

Let me fix this by adding `MessageOk` to the list of allowed commands when not logged in: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've added `Config.Constants.CommandName.MessageOk` to the list of allowed commands when the user is not logged in. Now when the login fails, the message will be displayed along with the bottom menu containing the "OK" button, allowing the user to close the message and return to the login screen.

The fix ensures that error messages (like "Login failed") can be properly dismissed even when the user hasn't logged in yet.
